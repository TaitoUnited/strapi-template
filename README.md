[//]: # (TEMPLATE NOTE START)

# strapi-template

Template for Strapi CMS running on Kubernetes or Docker Compose.

You can create a new project from this template by running `taito project create strapi-template`. Later you can upgrade your project to the latest version of the template by running `taito project upgrade`. To ensure flawless upgrade, do not modify files that have a **do-not-modify** note in them as they are designed to be reusable and easily configurable for various needs. In such case, improve the original files of the template instead, and then upgrade. See [Taito CLI](https://taitounited.github.io/taito-cli/) for more information.

NOTE: This template is a subset of [full-stack-template](https://github.com/TaitoUnited/full-stack-template/). Use the full-stack-template instead, if you need more than just a Strapi CMS.
